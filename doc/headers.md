# lingress Headers

[lingress](../README.md) provides many industry standard headers out-of-the-box, without enabling them.

## Headers
| Name | Client▶️ | LoadBalancer▶️ | ▶️Upstream | ▶️Client | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| `X-Correlation-Id` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Has to be base64 encoded UUID, without padding. This one is forwarded through the whole lifecycle of the requests, to help a client to identify its own resources at responses. If not provided, it will be generated by lingress. This is quite similar to `X-Request-Id`. |
| `X-Forwarded-For` | | ✅ | ✅ |  | <p>If lingress is behind of another load balancer and `--server.behindReverseProxy=true`, lingress will use this header to identify the remote client.</p><p>In any case this header is send to the upstream to tell the upstream the IP/host of the remote client.</p> |
| `X-Forwarded-Host` | | ✅ | ✅ |  | Same as `X-Forwarded-For` but for the host name which was requested by the client. |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto` | | ✅ | ✅ |  | Same as `X-Forwarded-For` but for the proto/scheme which was requested by the client. Can be `http` or `https`. |
| `X-Forwarded-Prefix` | | ✅ | ✅ |  | <p>If in the ingress configuration there was a [spec.rules.http.paths.path](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#the-ingress-resource) used, the matched prefix is contained in this header, send to the upstream.</p><p>If lingress is behind of another load balancer and `--server.behindReverseProxy=true`, lingress will use this header to identify the original uri if it was rewritten by the load balancer.</p> |
| `X-Original-URI` | | ✅ | | | If lingress is behind of another load balancer and `--server.behindReverseProxy=true`, lingress will use this header to identify the original uri if it was rewritten by the load balancer. This header is used in cases if the load balancer does not support `X-Forwarded-Prefix`. |
| `X-Real-IP` | | ✅ | | | If lingress is behind of another load balancer and `--server.behindReverseProxy=true`, lingress will use this header to identify the remote client. This header is used in cases if the load balancer does not support `X-Forwarded-For`. |
| `X-Reason` | | | | ✅ | This header is send to the clients in the response to tell why some actions happens. Currently supported: `cors-options`, `force-secure` and `not-whitelisted`. |
| `X-Request-Id` | | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Is a base64 encoded UUID, without padding. This one is forwarded through the whole lifecycle of the requests, once the request reached lingress. It is always generated by lingress and this cannot be changed. This is quite similar to `X-Correlation-Id`. |
| `X-Source` | | | | ✅ | This header is send to the clients in the response to explain from which ingress configuration the response was coming from. Absent means: No matching ingress configuration was found. Usually the fallback will answer then. |
